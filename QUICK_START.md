## 🧬 Complete Workflow Guide

### 1. **Theme Selection** 🎨
- Use the sidebar theme selector
- Choose from: Light Mode, Dark Mode, or Medical Professional
- Theme applies instantly across the entire interface

### 2. **MRI Upload & Analysis** 🧠
- Upload FLAIR NIfTI files (.nii or .nii.gz)
- Click "🚀 Run Segmentation Analysis"
- AI automatically processes and segments the brain scan
- View results in multiple anatomical planes

### 3. **Clinical Analysis** (When Tumor Detected) 🧬
- Navigate to "🧬 Clinical Analysis" tab
- Complete the comprehensive clinical form:
  
  **👤 Patient Information:**
  - Age (1-120 years)
  - Gender (Female/Male/Other)  
  - Genetic Risk Score (0-10)
  
  **🏥 Medical History:**
  - Family History of Brain Tumors (Yes/No)
  - Chronic Illness (No/Yes)
  - Diabetes (Yes/No)
  - Blood Pressure High/Low (Yes/No)
  
  **🧠 MRI & Clinical Findings:**
  - MRI Findings Location (auto-filled from AI detection)
  - Symptom Severity (Severe/Moderate/Mild)
  
  **🚭 Lifestyle Factors:**
  - Smoking History (Normal/Abnormal/Severe)
  - Alcohol Consumption (Yes/No)
  - Radiation Exposure (Yes/No)
  - Head Injury History (Low/Medium/High)

### 4. **AI Clinical Predictions** 🤖
- Submit the clinical form
- Get AI predictions for:
  - **Tumor Type**: Benign or Malignant
  - **Growth Rate**: Rapid, Slow, or Moderate
  - **Confidence Levels**: High (>80%), Medium (>60%), Low (<60%)

### 5. **Medical Insights** 🏥
- View clinical recommendations
- Understand key contributing factors
- Get professional guidance on next steps

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **Session State Error**
**Fixed!** ✅ The app now properly initializes session state before using it.

#### 2. **TensorFlow Warning**
```
WARNING: TensorFlow not available. H5 model predictions will be disabled.
```
**Solution:** This is expected and doesn't affect core functionality. To enable H5 predictions:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

#### 3. **File Path Issues**
**Fixed!** ✅ All file paths now use proper escaping for Windows.

#### 4. **Theme Not Working**
**Fixed!** ✅ Theme system now handles both Streamlit and non-Streamlit contexts.

### Performance Tips
- Use smaller MRI files for faster processing
- Close unused browser tabs to free memory
- Restart the app if experiencing slow performance

## 📊 What's New vs Original
