## 🧬 Clinical Workflow Guide

### Step 1: MRI Upload & Segmentation
1. Upload FLAIR NIfTI files (.nii/.nii.gz)
2. Click "🚀 Run Segmentation Analysis"
3. AI automatically detects and segments tumors
4. View results in multiple anatomical planes

### Step 2: Clinical Analysis (When Tumor Detected)
1. Navigate to "🧬 Clinical Analysis" tab
2. Complete the clinical information form:
   
   **👤 Patient Information**
   - Age (1-120 years)
   - Gender (Female/Male/Other)
   - Genetic Risk Score (0-10)
   
   **🏥 Medical History**
   - Family History of Brain Tumors
   - Chronic Illness
   - Diabetes Status
   - Blood Pressure (High/Low)
   
   **🧠 MRI & Clinical Findings**
   - MRI Findings Location (auto-filled from AI)
   - Symptom Severity (Severe/Moderate/Mild)
   
   **🚭 Lifestyle & Environmental Factors**
   - Smoking History
   - Alcohol Consumption
   - Radiation Exposure
   - Head Injury History

### Step 3: AI Predictions
1. Submit the clinical form
2. AI models analyze the data
3. Get predictions for:
   - **Tumor Type**: Benign or Malignant
   - **Growth Rate**: Rapid, Slow, or Moderate
   - **Confidence Scores**: High (>80%), Medium (>60%), Low (<60%)

### Step 4: Clinical Recommendations
- **High-risk cases**: Urgent oncological consultation recommended
- **Low-risk cases**: Regular monitoring advised
- **Mixed indicators**: Close follow-up and additional testing

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
Converts clinical form data to numerical features:
```python
# Example feature vector for H5 models
[Age, Tumor_Size, Genetic_Risk, Blood_Pressure_High, 
 Blood_Pressure_Low, Gender, Tumor_Location, MRI_Findings,
 Smoking_History, Alcohol_Consumption, Radiation_Exposure,
 Head_Injury_History, Chronic_Illness, Diabetes, Family_History,
 Symptom_Severity]
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Components

#### 1. Clinical Models (`clinical_models.py`)
```python
# Initialize predictor
from clinical_models import get_clinical_predictor
predictor = get_clinical_predictor()

# Make predictions
predictions = predictor.predict_tumor_characteristics(
    form_data, tumor_info
)
```

#### 2. Theme Manager (`theme_manager.py`)
```python
# Apply theme
from theme_manager import get_theme_manager
theme_manager = get_theme_manager()
theme_manager.apply_theme()
```

#### 3. Clinical Form (`clinical_form.py`)
```python
# Render form
from clinical_form import get_clinical_form
clinical_form = get_clinical_form()
form_submitted = clinical_form.render_form(tumor_info)
```

### Enhanced UNET Integration
```python
# Analyze tumor prediction
from model import analyze_tumor_prediction
analysis = analyze_tumor_prediction(mri_volume, pred_mask)

# Returns:
{
    'tumor_detected': bool,
    'tumor_location': str,  # Anatomical region
    'tumor_size': int,      # Voxel count
    'brain_tumor_present': int  # For H5 model
}
```
